Logging in takes user to Users#show (profile page)

UsersController:
  Users#show
    renders:
      Total spending today / this week / this month / this year
      Log new cart -> CartsController#new
      View carts -> CartsController#index
      View items -> ItemsController#index
      View stores -> StoresController#index

CartsController:
  Carts#index
    renders:
      list of all user's carts, sorted by: date, amount, store
      for each item, list shows:
        date, total amount, store (BestBuy), note ("Laptop stuff")
      expand item control on each: (JS)
        shows each cart_item with price, item name, cart_item note
      edit item button on each:
        -> Carts#edit for that cart

  Carts#show
    renders:
      details for a specific cart, including:
        date (AJAX edit)
        total (updates automatically in response to item edits)
        note (AJAX edit)
        store (can select another from drop down or make a new one - AJAX form slides down)
        store location (dropdown that updates if you change store, can add new)
        list of cart_items, showing the following for each:
          name
          price
          note
          tags

          for each cart_item, we can change the price & change the note,
          or delete the cart_item altogether
          we can also delete or add tags

        we can also, on this page, add new cart_items
          that form requires you to choose / create an item,
          specify a price,
          and optionally add a note and tags

  


I don't understand where to put the store location. Should it be its own model?

where does something like brand go?
it can go on the item itself, in which case the items become very specific
or it can go on the cartitem, in which case


Let's say a cart just has all these tags, like "Target", "online", etc



Maybe we can say a cart has many stores
