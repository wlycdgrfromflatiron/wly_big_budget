# wly's Big Budget
### flexible budgeting for mavens and minnows

A budgeting app with prefab stores and items, tag-based prefab and purchase classification,
and multi-item purchases. Created in Rails as part of my Flatiron School studies.

To try it:
* Clone the repo
* Run rails db:migrate and rails db:seed to create and seed the database
(Note: you will need to use the user accounts provided by the seed file;
new user account creation currently flows through a locked-down Mailgun email confirmation
flow test account, so you will not be able to activate a new user)
* Run rails s and visit the site at localhost:3000
